## FAQs
### What advantages does Markdown offer over a word processor?
- Markdown files can be version controlled using tools like Git, which is not possible with word processors. Etter also highlights that Markdown allows for better collaboration as multiple people can easily edit and review the same file without compatibility issues.

### How can I resolve a 404 error when trying to access my resume link?
- Firstly, ensure that you have named your repository as {your-username}.github.io as this is necessary for hosting a resume on GitHub Pages. 
- Next, check the settings of your repository and ensure that the branch is pointing to the main branch where all the files are located.
- Verify that your repository is set to public to allow access to the resume link.
These steps should help you resolve the issue.
